Have you ever had that one app that you habitually use?
Or even just an app that you have been spending too much time on?


Rehabit helps you rehab from app addiction by shuffling your apps to break old habits and reduce environmental cues

Functions:
Randomize: With the swipe of a button, your apps will be shuffled around to prevent your muscle memory from tapping on those addicting apps

If shuffling is not enough to stop you from using your most addicting app, try Hide-and Seek for the ultimate Rehabit experience.

Hide-and-Seek: Itâ€™s a hassle to shuffle all of your apps if you are only addicted to one of them, so Hide-and-Seek creates eight dummy clones of your app to hinder you from opening the app.
